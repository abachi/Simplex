## Simplex method
During my master's degree, I implemented [The simplex method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm) as a class using PHP to better understand it and to easily check my manual solutions. I only had to write the given data and constraints in a text file and let the script to show me the solution.

Clone
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:abachi/Simplex.git  
```
Run tests:
```bash
$ php phpunit-5.7.27.phar tests\
```
